											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Hello! I am a recent graduate of Georgetown University's data science and analytics program, and I am currently seeking a data science position in the DC area. I am a passionate and creative person, and what draws me to data science is how it can be both analytical and imaginative.</p>

											<p>To me, data science is not just about analyzing data and finding patterns, but also about telling a story through the data. I believe that data science can be a powerful tool for discovering insights and solving complex problems in any industry.</p>
											
										<p>When I am not working with data, I enjoy exploring my creative side through art. I love to paint, draw, sew, crochet, and knit, and I host monthly craft nights at my apartment to share my love of crafting with others. I also enjoy staying active by running and hiking, and I always have a good book on hand to read in my downtime.</p>
											
									<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

								<p>Gender discrimination remains a significant human rights issue, as women worldwide experience job segregation, employment inequity, pay gaps, and limited freedom in career choice. As a response to this issue, our research provides a comprehensive set of tools to examine gender inequities in education, labor force participation, and career advancement over time and by location. Our team, composed of women in tech, focused specifically on gender disparities in STEM fields. Through our analysis, we examined how men and women differ in terms of test scores, entrance into professional fields, labor participation, parental leave, and salaries. Our goal is to contribute to a greater understanding of the pervasive effects of gender discrimination and to promote evidence-based solutions that can create a more equitable and inclusive society.</p>

									<h2>Big Data Derby</h2>

								<p>This study aims to determine the feasibility of predicting the winner of a horse race, in response to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/big-data-derby-2022">Big Data Derby 2022 Kaggle Competition</a>. The competition seeks to improve equine welfare and help owners, trainers, and veterinarians assess competition strategy. We built an artificial neural network (ANN) model that uses the Keras functional API to process numerical, categorical, and text data in order to predict the target variables. The output of our ANN model was compared to traditional machine learning methods such as random forest, logistic regression, and gradient boost. Our research provides an in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of the ANN model in predicting the winner of a horse race, and contributes to ongoing efforts to improve equine welfare through data analysis and machine learning.</p>

								<p>During my master's degree program, my group and I completed a project for the Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing course using R. We investigated inequality in risk and exposure to COVID-19 across the United States, with a particular emphasis on college campuses and prisons. Our analysis included conditional probability models, hypothesis testing, and multivariate regression analysis. We aimed to answer several questions, such as whether people in different regions of the country face different risk profiles for contracting COVID-19, whether certain subsets of the population are more susceptible to the virus, and what factors influence the risk. Our investigation focused on population size, mask usage, and political leaning as the primary risk factors.</p>

									<h2>SQL Airport project</h2>
									<span class="image"><img src="projects/SQL/airplane.png" alt="" height=200 width=300 /><p style="font-size: 9px;"></p></span>
								</header>
								<p>The SQL airport project is a mini-project that I completed as part of a database management course. The project involved creating a database schema and queries for a hypothetical airport, with the goal of efficiently managing information about flights, passengers, and airport staff.</p>

							<p>The project required me to analyze the airport's data needs and design a normalized database schema that avoids redundancy and maintains data integrity. I used SQL to create tables, define primary and foreign keys, and insert sample data.</p>
									
						<p>I then developed a series of queries that enable users to retrieve and update data on flights, passengers, and staff. The queries cover a range of scenarios, such as searching for flights by date, time, or destination, updating passenger information, and generating reports on staff schedules and availability.</p>
									
					<p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in database design, SQL query writing, and data analysis. The project demonstrates my ability to design efficient and effective database solutions and to leverage SQL to manage complex data sets.
